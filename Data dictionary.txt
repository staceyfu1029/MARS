1. T1.csv
This file contains the reconstructed survival data. 

survtime: reconstructed survival time of individual patients
censor: censoring status, 0=censored and 1=event
group: MRD status, 0=MRD positive and 1=MRD negative
event: types of event, all types other than overall survival (OS) are considered as disease-free survival (DFS)
pmid: PMID for the individual study

2. T2.csv
This file contains the log HR estimates and corresponding standard errors.

PMID: PMID for the individual study
Event: types of event, all types other than overall survival (OS) are considered as disease-free survival (DFS)
ref: reference group, "N" means it is the ratio of the positive group to the MRD negative group
HR: HR estimates
HR.l95, HR.u95: lower and upper limits of 95% confidence intervals.
LOG.HR: log HR estimates
LOG.HR.SE: the standard error for the log HR estimates.
included in T1: indicator that if the study has reconstructed survival data

3. T3.csv
This file contains the survival rates and corresponding standard errors.

PMID: PMID for the individual study
MRD_group: indicators for MRD status, 0=MRD positive and 1=MRD negative
Event: types of event, all types other than overall survival (OS) are considered as disease-free survival (DFS)
time (in months): time points for the reported survival rates
survival rate: estimated survival probabilities
std.err: estimated standard errors
